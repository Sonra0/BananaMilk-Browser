# 🍌 BananaMilk 🥛

**The search engine you have to search for to use.**

A deliciously pointless web search interface built for the CTRL HACK DEL .2 hackathon's "Most Useless Project" category.

## 🤔 What is BananaMilk?

BananaMilk is a fully functional search interface with one tiny, magnificent flaw: **you need to use a search engine to find our search engine before you can search for anything.**

Want to Google something? First, Google "BananaMilk," click our link, *then* use our site to Google it. It's like buying a map to find the map store. Peak efficiency. Zero utility.

## ✨ Features

- 🍌 **Banana-themed UI** - Because why not make something useless look amazing?
- 🔍 **Actual search functionality** - Redirects to Google search results
- 🌐 **Direct URL navigation** - Type a URL and we'll take you there (eventually)
- 🎨 **Smooth animations** - Floating bananas, milk splashes, and ripple effects
- 🥛 **Responsive design** - Works on all devices (still useless on all of them)
- 🎯 **Zero practical value** - Our main feature

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (no frameworks needed)
- **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Fredoka One, Nunito)
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages / Any static hosting
- **Backend:** None (we keep it simple and useless)

## 💻 Usage

1. Open Google (or any search engine)
2. Search for "BananaMilk"
3. Click our link
4. Now search for what you originally wanted
5. Reflect on your life choices

**OR** just bookmark it and skip step 1-3 (but where's the fun in that?)

## 🎯 Why Does This Exist?

Because someone at CTRL HACK DEL .2 decided to award a prize for the **Most Useless Project**, and we took that challenge seriously.

We could've built something practical, useful, or innovative. Instead, we built a search engine that requires searching to find. And we're proud of it.
